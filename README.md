# Push Swap

Welcome to Push Swap, a sorting project from 42 School! The goal of this project is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations, while keeping the number of moves as low as possible. Push Swap challenged me to explore sorting algorithms and optimize performance, and includes a bonus feature that adds further complexity.

## Project Overview

Push Swap involves two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a set of predefined operations (like `sa` for swap, `ra` for rotate, `pb` for push to stack `b`, etc.). The task is to sort the integers in stack `a` in ascending order with the fewest possible moves. This project helped build a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms, stack manipulation, and optimization strategies.

### Bonus Features

The bonus part of the project adds an interactive mode, where commands can be entered manually to perform operations on the stacks. This mode was a great way to deepen understanding of stack operations and verify the solution in real-time.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implements stack-based sorting with optimized operations for different input sizes.
- **Two-Stack Operations**: Handles standard stack operations (`sa`, `pb`, `ra`, etc.) to manage the sorting process.
- **Interactive Mode (Bonus)**: Enables manual input of commands to test and verify stack manipulation.

## Usage

To use Push Swap, compile the code and provide a list of integers as arguments. The program will output the sequence of operations needed to sort them. In bonus mode, commands can be entered manually to perform operations on the stacks interactively.

## Compilation

To compile the project, run:
```bash
make
```

This will create the `push_swap` executable. To enable the interactive bonus mode, run the program with the appropriate bonus flags or commands as specified.

Push Swap was a valuable project for developing sorting techniques, algorithmic thinking, and performance optimization. Feel free to explore the code and see how the challenge of efficient sorting was tackled!
